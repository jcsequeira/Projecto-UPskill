    <b>UPSkill 2023 - JAVA course final project: A Desktop JavaFX App Designed for Art Galleries, with a Rest API implementation and a local MySQL database, also populated with real-world data from the https://developers.artsy.net </b>
</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

This is a final course project, so it is not optimized. The task was to create a JavaFX Desktop App for Galleries to keep track of their Artwork, Shows, and possibly some extra functionalities.<br>
Warning: The full App is in Portuguese, but may one day be updated to English, or an implemented Java Internationalization (*.properties) for practice.
<br>
<h3>Our Approach Designing this project:</h3>
<h4>We decided to divide the App into 3 mini-apps:</h4>

- **ExplorArt**: Main JavaFX Desktop App, the frontend. It will start the RestAPI server on startup, wait until it's ready, and then initialize the GUI. It will also stop the server on exit.
- **RestAPI**: A Rest API made with the SparkJava Framework that will handle ALL CRUD operations on the MySQL local database. No JPA/Hibernate or any ORM framework was used, only Java SQL, JDBC, and Gson libraries.
- **ArtsyLoader**: The most interesting work of this project. This app will make GET requests to the Artsy API online, with a lot of elements in one JSON, perform Data Object Conversion, along with other necessary operations, and make POST requests to our RestAPI.<br>
 It makes use of streams, generics, the collections framework, threads, and parsing to perform the necessary algorithms. 

<h2 id="technologies">üíª Technologies</h2>

- Java for Backend
- JavaFX for Frontend
- MySQL for DB
- Rest API for CRUD operations on the DB
- SparkJava framework for the API

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<h4>Follow the instructions below or watch the full video tutorial here: <br> 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gui7ZIIuG9I</h4>

<h3>Install:</h3>

- [GitHub](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [IntelliJ Idea Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC)
- [Java 17 Liberica](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-17-lts)
- [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
  
<h3>Cloning</h3>

After installing Git, open Windows PowerShell, cmd, or GitBash, navigate to the desired directory using the "cd" command, and type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcsequeira/Projecto-UPskill.git
```

<h3>Setting up the MySQL Database</h2>

- Start MySQL Workbench and login into your local MySQL server, that you set up on MySQL installation.
- Copy the content on "[create.sql](https://github.com/jcsequeira/Projecto-UPskill/blob/master/create.sql)" and paste it on your Workbench script.
- Run the script and that should be it.


<h3>Starting</h3>

How to start the App:

- Open the project in IntelliJ, select the Liberica JDK 17.0.11 and reload maven pom.
- Run ExplorArtApp/src/main/java/ExplorArtApp.java.
- On first, run db is empty, you can create your own data using the app or import from ArtsyAPI.
- To Import data from Artsy API, Menu Admin->Importar Dados da Arsty API.
- To delete All Data Imported from Artsy API, Menu Admin->Limpar Dados da Arsty API.

<h2 id="artsy">üìç Artsy API</h2>

[Artsy API](https://developers.artsy.net/v2/) is an API to obtain data from the [https://www.artsy.net/](https://www.artsy.net/) website that has real world data, about Artworks, Artists, Gallerys, Events, Auctions and so on.
In this project, Artsy data was used to populate the App database, for testing purposes.
